# Py-Properties

**py-properties** is a `Python` library which can be used to parse and read 
a .properties file and use the key-value as dict.


The idea behind the library is to provide a similar inteface as
the [Properties](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/properties.html)
class used in Java.


Currently, the package is being uploaded to [testpypi](https://test.pypi.org/project/py-properties/)
and is in `0.0.1-alpha` version. Someday, this might(hopefully) will be moved to the production index.
